# Maze Solver

This is a guided project from boot.dev to make a maze solver using Python.

## Project Summary

Use Python and Tkinter to build a GUI that solves mazes. You'll be writing code that draws a randomized maze and then systematically solves it. You will use your knowledge of algorithms to automate this fun game! This is a fantastic way to build another real project and solidify your algorithmic skills.
